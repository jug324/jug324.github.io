			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
			<p>I'm Justin Gilman. I tend to use J. E. Gilman as a pen name, though. I was born and raised in the foothills of Vermont's Green Mountains. I'm also an only child. Active Imagination + Open Rural Setting = Run of the Mill Fantasy Writer. The math doesn't get any simpler than that.</p>
			<p>I love telling stories, but admittedly find the act of writing to be a chore. I'm pretty sure I would have made a good bard a millennium ago. Okay, "good" is maybe too strong a word. Decent, maybe? I do know how to read and play music, so if anything I imagine I could have made a living as a minstrel with the hopes of becoming a renown bard. Got to have professional ambitions, right?</p>
			<p>Back in the real world, I currently live in Massachusetts. While I do hold down a steady day job, I try to make an effort to write on a regular basis. I also dabble with web coding (you're looking at the fruits of my labor right now!)</p>
			<p>If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me using the following:</p>
