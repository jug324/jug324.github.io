	<p class="p1">With everything in the world being as it is, I decided to move the release of <i>All Things Good and Proper</i> up a month to October 7th. Pre-order copies can still be bought on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HPDNKBT?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, although only digital. They apparently don't offer the pre-order scheme for physical. But paperbacks will be ready to purchase come release day, so, just use the same link then.</p>
	<p class="p1">I have to (temporarily) drop the Gumroad option. Basically, Amazon offers you incentives to list your ebook only with them and it's really hard to see the value in what they offer. Like my other works, the Gumroad option will come back after I've had some time to see how well it does on just Amazon.</p>
