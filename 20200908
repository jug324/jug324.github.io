	<p class="p1">I made some attempts with this novel to see if an agent or publisher would want to take it on. In the end, I just don't think I have the drive for it. I love writing stories, but trying to be even recognized in the publishing world is like a full time job. Unfortunately, I already have one of those. I'm sure the pandemic didn't help either...</p>
	<p class="p1">Enough sobering reality. If you're interested in some comical fantasy, order a digital copy today via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HPDNKBT?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://gum.co/atgap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumroad</a>. (Physical copies will be available soon.)</p>
